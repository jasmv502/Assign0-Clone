## Experience

##### Renesas Electronics

Intern: Software Development Engineer         

- Designed AI-based solutions to identify fraudulent activities in sample order requests on Renesas’ E-commerce platform.

- Implemented a data collection pipeline on AWS, using Lambda Functions, triggered by data uploads to an S3 bucket.

  This process efficiently dispatched API fetch requests to SQS, with the resultant data stored in DocumentDB.

- Conducted data preprocessing, data augmentation, feature engineering, and trained weighted-ensemble ML models

  for fraud detection, achieving a 95% accuracy post-production.

- Engineered a serverless cloud workflow on AWS, integrating API Gateway and Lambda functions to create a RESTful

  backend API, effectively managing order request processing.

- Deployed SageMaker endpoints to detect fraudulence for real-time fraud detection in order requests, which

  prevented 60% financial loss, reduced 50% labor cost, and decreased the overall order request processing time by 50%.

##### NHB: Intelligent Medical Systems

Intern: Software Development Engineer

- Fine-tuned an OCR model specifically for invoice image using PaddlePaddle, with an accuracy increase of 15%.

- Implemented interactive bounding boxes using React on invoice images, enabling dragging and resizing adjustments

  around target area. This process segments the image into smaller sections, based on the bounding boxes’ coordinates.

- Developed RESTful APIs using Django for image processing, formatting OCR model outputs, and saving to MySQL

  databases. Successfully onboarded 4 hospitals to the semi-automatic invoice recognition tool, achieving a 75% reduction in manual invoice input time.

## Project

##### Concert Sharing and Ticket Selling Website 

> React, Express, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, NATS

- Developed a single-page application for concert sharing and ticket selling, featuring sorting, filtering, and dark mode

- Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, Redux and React Query for state management, and memoization techniques for

  performance optimization.

- Designed an event-driven microservices backend using Express, MongoDB and Redis, integrated NATS for event bus

  communication, and incorporated Jest for unit testing and JWT for secure authentication.

- Achieved efficient and scalable deployment on multiple clusters using Docker and Kubernetes.

##### Photo Sharing Website

> React, Spring Cloud, Kafka, Docker

- Engineered a responsive photo-sharing web application utilizing React and Material UI, incorporating features such as

  customizable photo uploads, commenting capabilities, and friend tagging

- Implemented microservices with Spring Cloud, managed configurations with the Config Server, and set up load

  balancing through Eureka.

- Utilized Zipkin to monitor distributed services and enhance the system availability.

- Developed message queue services and built a high-throughput log collection platform with Kafka.

##### Text Classification with Language Models and Graph Structures

> Pytorch, DGL, Azure, AWS

- Proposed a novel approach for text classification by integrating language model embeddings and graph structures.
- Enhanced F1 score by 10% on the Amazon dataset after combining a custom GATBiGRU model with original BERT.
- Conducted analyses comparing traditional frequency embeddings and advanced LLM embeddings in GNN tasks.

##### Autonomous Car Navigation

> C++, ROS, Python

- Adopted Vins-fusion SLAM module with ROS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform and Intel RealSense D435i camera.
- Utilized position and depth data from SLAM to build OctoMap and run A* algorithm for route planning.
- Used Gazebo simulation and Python pymavlink to test the autonomous car in a maze and optimized the system.

##### I386 simulator

> C, Linux

- Developed a software simulation of an i386 computer system in C and successfully ran an RPG game on the simulator.

- Implemented the x86 instruction set, cache scheduling algorithms (LRU and FIFO), integrated memory management

  techniques (segmentation and paging), multi-threading and I/O device management.

- Emulated i386 components, including ALU, memory, serial ports, I/O, interrupts, exceptions, and system calls.
